# Chatbot Creation

#### This project is a simple chatbot built with Python that uses intent classification to respond to user inputs. The chatbot identifies user intent based on pre-defined patterns in intents.json and provides responses accordingly.

## Features

Intent classification to understand user queries.
Customizable intents.json file for adding or modifying intents and responses.
Randomized responses from a set of predefined responses for each intent.

## Project Structure

#### -> intents.json: Contains various intents, each with patterns (phrases that trigger the intent) and responses (replies from the bot).

#### chatbot.py: Main code for the chatbot, which includes:

#### -> predict_intent_tag(sentence): A function that predicts the intent tag for a given user sentence.

#### -> get_response(tag): A function that returns a random response from the intents.json file based on the predicted intent tag.

#### -> chatbot_response(sentence): Combines intent prediction and response generation to provide a complete chatbot response.

## Project Analysis and Future Scope

This chatbot demonstrates a foundational approach to intent classification without machine learning.

#### Some future improvements could include:

#### (->)Machine Learning Integration: Adding NLP and ML techniques like word embeddings or TF-IDF to improve accuracy.

#### (->)Advanced Pattern Matching: Leveraging regex or NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy to enhance pattern detection.

## Screenshots and Explaination

#### Python libraries such as json for data handling and random for response selection are fundamental to this project.

Jupyter Notebook Lab provides the testing environment for the chatbot, facilitating real-time testing and debugging.
The chatbot's primary function, chatbot_response, integrates both intent prediction and response generation.
Future expansions can include using machine learning or NLP libraries to enhance accuracy and allow more flexible, robust responses.

#### -> The objective of this project is to develop a simple, rule-based chatbot capable of recognizing user intent and generating relevant responses.

## Conclusion

This project offers an understanding of how a rule-based chatbot can be developed using Python and JSON data structures. By expanding the intents.json file and modifying the classification algorithm, one can customize and scale the chatbotâ€™s capabilities. This project provides a foundation for exploring more advanced AI-driven chatbots in future studies.
